####js Game ideas

* Rogue-like
* not grid-based
* control a party that is randomly created at new game
* races with different starting stats _**???**_
* classes with different skills
 * Warrior
 * Mage
 * Archer
* warriors > mages > archers > warriors bonus dmg  _**???**_
* stats:
  * strength - boosts base attack damage and health
  * agi - boosts speed & crit
  * magic  - boosts mana, gives extra spells 
* every stat should be useful for every character
 * warrior:
   * strength: high damage, low speed & crit
   * agility: high crit & speed, lower damage
   * magic: extra "enchantment" damage - e.g. +x% fire/water/lightning damage
 * mage:
   * strength: lower mana but high damage
   * agility/dexterity: high magic crit and speed but low damage & mana
   * magic mage high mana & extra spells but lower base damage and crit %
 * Archer:
   * strength: high damage
   * agi: high speed & crit
   * mana: extra enchantment damage
* 4 damage types:
 * Lightning > Water > Fire > Physical > Lightning
* turn based combat
 * pokemon-esque
 * limited number of skills per party member (3/4/6?)
 * turn order based on speed which is derived from agility
   * if speeds are equal - archers are faster than mages are faster than warriors
   * if same classes - randomise weighted towards one with higher total stats (e.g. 10str, 15agi, 10mag roll 1-20, 15str, 15agi, 15mag rolls 10-20)
 * **not strict turns!**
   * i.e. child of light ish combat
   * not player then ai then player etc...
   * based on speed characters will be ranked
   * character with 100 speed will attack twice in the same amount of time a character with 50 speed attacks once
